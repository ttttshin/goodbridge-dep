# Release Notes for GoodFriends Matching and Future-Proofing The Code

We are thrilled to announce the release of our latest updates to our webapp. In the final iteration, we focused on implementing the GoodFriends matching flow, with a matching page, user cards, and a matches section where matched users can contact each other. We also worked no future-proofing the code. Here are the details:

## GoodFriends Matching:

Created a new matching page where users can view potential matches and interact with them
Designed a new matches section where matched users can communicate with each other
Added matches cards to display information about potential matches

## Future-Proofing The Code:
Upgraded the app's infrastructure to ensure compatibility with future updates
Refactored code for better scalability and maintainability

We have also produced a handover document which will be sent to the customer. Further to this, we also have a video guide of how to set up and use the site. This is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h-jElLlyz_OyLh6QONTXA2SheoYJId1b/view?usp=sharing).
